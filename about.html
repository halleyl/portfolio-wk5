        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Lauren! I'm originally from New Jersey, and I moved to the Seattle area in 2004. I live in Capitol Hill with my husband and our dog.</p>

        <h3>Work</h3> 
        <p>I've worked in customer service and retail sales for most of my career, and I'm currently the manager of an e-commerce business. I've always been interested in web development, and started teaching myself HTML way back in the 90s. Changing careers to front end development has been a years-long goal of mine, and I'm excited to learn new skills!</p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I really enjoy singing and writing music. I'm in a band that has never released anything or played live (but it's fun anyway!) After becoming vegan about a decade ago, I've gotten really into cooking as well. I love to try new recipes and explore cuisines that I'm not as familiar with. I also spend (too much) time watching Netflix or playing video games.</p>
